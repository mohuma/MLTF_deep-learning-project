### Date created
Image Classifier project in Python/Jupyter was created on 15-Dec-2021.

### Project Title
**Build your own Image Classifier**

### Description
In the first part of the project I built and trained an image classifier (deep
neural network) to recognize different species of flowers. 

In the second part, I created an application using Python that can run from the
command line and use the trained network created in part 1 to predict the top
flower names from an image along with their corresponding probabilities.

### Files used
[oxford_flowers102 from TensorFlow datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/oxford_flowers102) consisting of 102 flower categories.

label_map.json - a file to map labels to flower names.

### Output created
Image_Classifier.ipynb - Developing an Image Classifier with Deep Learning.

predict.py - Building the command line application.

### Credits
The dataset for this project originates from [University of Oxford](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html).
